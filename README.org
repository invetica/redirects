* Usage
#+begin_src clojure
  (ns app.service
    (:require [invetica.redirects :as redirects]))

  ;; Create a registry of hostnames you want to redirect to a canonical
  ;; (optionally with HTTPS scheme) URL.
  (def registry
    (redirects/compile-sites
     #{{:site/canonical "www.example.com"}
       {:site/canonical "www.invetica.co.uk"
        :site/aliases #{"invetica.co.uk"
                        "invetika.co.uk"}
        :site/https? true}}))

  ;; Call `invetica.redirects/canonical-redirect` with your compiled registry, and
  ;; the request map.
  ;;
  ;; If a redirect is needed, a Ring-compatible response map will be returned. If
  ;; not, you'll get `nil` back.
